user: Say "Hello world" in Python
assistant: Sure, here is how to say "Hello world" in Python:

```
print("Hello world")
```
user: Now do it in Ruby
assistant: Sure I can do that! Here's a simple Ruby program that can be run in the console:

```
class ChatProgram
  def initialize
    puts "Hello! I'm a chat program. What's your name?"
    @name = gets.chomp
  end

  def start_chatting
    puts "Nice to meet you, #{@name}! How can I help you today?"
    loop do
      user_input = gets.chomp
      if user_input.downcase == "quit"
        break
      else
        response = generate_response(user_input)
        puts response
      end
    end
    puts "Goodbye!"
  end

  def generate_response(input)
    # Replace this with your own AI logic to generate responses
    return "I'm sorry, I don't understand."
  end
end

chat_program = ChatProgram.new
chat_program.start_chatting
```

This is a basic skeleton that defines a `ChatProgram` class with an `initialize` method that sets the user's name, and a `start_chatting` method that loops to receive user input and generate responses until the user types "quit".

To add AI capabilities, you would replace the `generate_response` method with your own logic to analyze the text input and generate an appropriate response. You could use natural language processing libraries like `nlp` or `stanford-core-nlp` to assist you with this.
