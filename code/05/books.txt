Travelling at Night
---
The annotated dream-journals of Christopher Illopoly, sometimes called 'the only readable occultist': literate, entertaining, bewildering. 'The Wood lies outside the walls of the Mansus. As any student of Histories knows, the Mansus has no walls.' Illopoly describes how he came to make repeated visits to a dream-Wood via what he calls silver dreams. 'Trying to think your way to the Wood,' he explains, 'is like thinking your way to being in love. But I did find a Secret that helped.'

The Skeleton Songs

Poems of greedy delight composed by the possibly pseudonymous Arabella Dusk, the rumoured heiress-turned-madam-turned-poetess. In Arabella's introduction, she explains that the book was to be illustrated, but that the Suppression Bureau would not permit it. She hints that the illustrations still exist somewhere. The book is dedicated to 'Sir Parsival of the Red Cup'. The Twenty-Six Delightful Fruits; the Seven Chastisements; the Nine Gardens; the Four Regrets.

The Locksmith's Dream

The first volume of Teresa Galmier's examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans. The parallels in mystic dreams experienced by carpenters, masons and other artisans, and what they purport to reveal about the architecture of the world. Sometimes mordant, sometimes funny. No-one has ever explained why Galmier devoted herself to this quixotic exploration of artisan's dreams. 'Time and again we hear of the Wood, which rises from the world's foundation. All trees reach for light. What does the Wood reach for? Is there a difference between light and Light? I think the key to dreams of the Wood might be one of these - the one that isn't exactly real.'
