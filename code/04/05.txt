Deep in the vast expanse of knowledge,
Far removed from the familiar words of men,
Far from the common phrases, and dialects of foreign lands,
Resides the mighty language model, still as a statue,
Silent, amidst the stillness of its lair;
Knowledge upon knowledge stored within its head,
A library of texts that stretch beyond the sky.
No disturbance from the outer world can penetrate,
The silence, unbroken, like a winter's night,
But when prompted in one tongue, and guided to another,
It will weave language, a master of communication,
Based on its vast understanding of the spoken word.
